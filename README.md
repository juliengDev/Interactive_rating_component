# Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This project is an interactive web component that allows users to rate from 1 to 5 stars and display the result in a modal. It was developed with a focus on accessibility and best practices in front-end development.

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a rating from 1 to 5 stars
- See an error message if they try to submit without selecting a rating
- View a confirmation modal after submitting their rating
- Navigate the application using only the keyboard
- See the optimal layout of the interface based on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- Observe hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- TypeScript
- Semantic HTML5
- Custom CSS for styling
- Mobile-first approach
- Accessibility at the core of development

### What I Learned

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of TypeScript and web accessibility. Here are some key takeaways:

1. Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript: I structured the code using a class, which improved the organization and maintainability of the code.
2. Advanced Accessibility: I implemented ARIA attributes and managed focus to ensure an inclusive user experience.
3. Error Handling: I added an accessible error handling system to improve user feedback.
4. Responsive Styles: I created styles that adapt to user preferences, including for motion reduction.

### Ongoing Development

In future projects, I would like to focus on:

- Integrating unit and integration tests
- Exploring CSS frameworks for more efficient styling
- Improving performance, especially for animations

### Useful Resources

[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) - An invaluable resource for understanding fundamental web concepts and best practices.  
[Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) - An excellent source of information on web accessibility.  
[TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - The official TypeScript documentation was crucial for mastering advanced concepts.
